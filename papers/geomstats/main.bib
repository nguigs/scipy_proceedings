However, the network of anatomical connections linking the neuronal elements of the human brain is still largely unknown. While some databases or collations of large-scale anatomical connection patterns exist for other mammalian species, there is currently no connection matrix of the human brain, nor is there a coordinated research effort to collect, archive, and disseminate this important information. We propose a research strategy to achieve this goal, and discuss its potential impact.},

	abstract = {Traditional relation extraction predicts relations within some fixed and finite target schema. Machine learning approaches to this task require either manual annotation or, in the case of distant supervision, existing structured sources of the same schema. The need for existing datasets can be avoided by using a universal schema: the union of all involved schemas (surface form predicates as in OpenIE, and relations in the schemas of preexisting databases). This schema has an almost unlimited set of relations (due to surface forms), and supports integration with existing structured data (through the relation types of existing databases). To populate a database of such schema we present matrix factorization models that learn latent feature vectors for entity tuples and relations. We show that such latent models achieve substantially higher accuracy than a traditional classification approach. More importantly, by operating simultaneously on relations observed in text and in pre-existing structured DBs such as Freebase, we are able to reason about unstructured and structured data in mutually-supporting ways. By doing so our approach outperforms stateof- the-art distant supervision.},

  abstract = 	 {Hyperbolic embeddings offer excellent quality with few dimensions when embedding hierarchical data structures. We give a combinatorial construction that embeds trees into hyperbolic space with arbitrarily low distortion without optimization. On WordNet, this algorithm obtains a mean-average-precision of 0.989 with only two dimensions, outperforming existing work by 0.11 points. We provide bounds characterizing the precision-dimensionality tradeoff inherent in any hyperbolic embedding. To embed general metric spaces, we propose a hyperbolic generalization of multidimensional scaling (h-MDS). We show how to perform exact recovery of hyperbolic points from distances, provide a perturbation analysis, and give a recovery result that enables us to reduce dimensionality. Finally, we extract lessons from the algorithms and theory above to design a scalable PyTorch-based implementation that can handle incomplete information.}

abstract = {Functional connectivity from resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) is typically represented as a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix. Analysis methods that exploit the Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices appropriately adhere to the positive definite constraint, unlike Euclidean methods. Recently proposed approaches for rsfMRI analysis have achieved high accuracy on public datasets, but are computationally intensive and difficult to interpret. In this paper, we show that we can get comparable results using connectivity matrices under the log-Euclidean and affine-invariant Riemannian metrics with relatively simple and interpretable models. On ABIDE Preprocessed dataset, our methods classify autism versus control subjects with 71.1{\%} accuracy. We also show that Riemannian methods beat baseline in regressing connectome features to subject autism severity scores.},

@inproceedings{Ng2014,
abstract = {We present a Riemannian approach for classifying fMRI connectivity patterns before and after intervention in longitudinal studies. A fundamental difficulty with using connectivity as features is that covariance matrices live on the positive semi-definite cone, which renders their elements inter-related. The implicit independent feature assumption in most classifier learning algorithms is thus violated. In this paper, we propose a matrix whitening transport for projecting the covariance estimates onto a common tangent space to reduce the statistical dependencies between their elements. We show on real data that our approach provides significantly higher classification accuracy than directly using Pearson's correlation. We further propose a non-parametric scheme for identifying significantly discriminative connections from classifier weights. Using this scheme, a number of neuroanatomically meaningful connections are found, whereas no significant connections are detected with pure permutation testing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},
